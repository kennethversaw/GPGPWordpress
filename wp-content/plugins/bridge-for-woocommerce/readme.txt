Leverage the power of both WooCommerce and Tickera to manage events and sell tickets

Leverage the power of both WooCommerce and Tickera to manage events and sell tickets

= Sell Event Tickets with WooCommerce =

With more than 10.000.000 downloads, WooCommerce is certainly the most popular e-commerce system for the WordPress platform. We have harnessed the power of almighty WooCommerce and came up with this great integration with Tickera Event Ticketing System called Bridge for WooCommerce. Sell tickets on your site and deliver them to your buyers using the awesomeness of this WooCommerce and Tickera fusion!

= Create Tickets Inside WooCommerce =

Creating tickets for an event is as easy as creating any other WooCommerce product. Each ticket can have its own SKU, price, stock, and even multiple variations! In addition, you can control sale price date easily and offer early bird tickets with just one click. Set the different ticket template and make a new look of each ticket type with Tickera ticket drag & drop template builder. Control number of allowed check-ins per ticket easily.

= Sell tickets and other products at the same time =

Have a cool T-Shirt for your event or want to offer option for your visitors to have lunch? Why not generating extra revenue with that? Offer your customers all the perks you have, easy and straight away!

= Check in attendees with phone apps or barcode readers =

Use Tickera check-in [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ticket-checkin/id958838933) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tickera.tickeraapp) apps or even a simple but efficient [Barcode Reader](https://tickera.com/addons/barcode-reader/). Just point your smartphone or barcode reader to the ticket, check-in and say "Welcome!"

= Extend WooCommerce order status e-mails =

Tickets in the mailbox! Right after purchasing a ticket, your customers will get the standard WooCommerce "Order Completed" e-mail with the download link to your ticket(s). Pretty cool, right?

= Create Custom Order Fields =

Need to know more than just name and email of you customers? Use [Tickera Custom Forms](https://tickera.com/addons/custom-forms/) and set everything up! Input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus... all at your disposal, any way you need, any way you like.
